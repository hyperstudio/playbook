title: Start from a clear scholarly or pedagogical need
---

We must begin digital projects by understanding the needs of the people who will use them. Whether the users are student, instructors or researchers, we must include real people in the design process from the beginning. Those people's needs — not constraints of existing tools or IT infrastructure — should inform technical and design decisions. We must also test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.

#### checklist
1. Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
2. Use a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
3. Test prototypes of solutions with real people, in the field if possible

#### key questions
- Who are your primary users?
- What user needs will this service address?
- Why does the user want or need this service?
- Which people will have the most difficulty with the service?
- Which research methods were used?
- What were the key findings?
- How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
- How often are you testing with real people?
- Test this branch.
