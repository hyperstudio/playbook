# The Hyperstudio Playbook

Digital Humanities projects are often exploratory and iterative in nature; they typically have small budgets and small teams; they are interdisciplinary and collaborative.

In developing over a dozen Digital Humanities software projects over the course of last 10 years at MIT Hyperstudio, we've developed strategies, approaches, and patterns that work very well under those constraints.

This playbook, modeled on the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/), is our attempt to codify those strategies.

It is a work in progress; we welcome your feedback, ideas, and input; if it looks useful, we invite you to fork it and modify it for your own DH practice.
